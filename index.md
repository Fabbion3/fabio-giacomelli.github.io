## About me

I am a PhD student in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies at [University of Rome Tor Vergata](https://web.uniroma2.it/) based in Rome.

## Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of algorithmic and game theoretical concepts with distributed networks, with a particular focus on blockchain technology. I am particularly interested in studying the foundation of layer 2 protocols. Through my research, I hope to contribute to the development of innovative and efficient solutions for decentralized systems.
